# UI patterns

How forms, lists, dialogs and comboboxes are built here. These are conventions,
not rules the compiler enforces — follow them so screens stay consistent and so
a reader can predict where the state lives.

## Forms

`react-hook-form` + `zod` + the **`@/components/ui/field`** primitives. More
flexible than shadcn's `Form` wrapper, and it keeps the schema visible at the
top of the file.

**Do:**

- Use `useForm` with `zodResolver`, and take the schema from the feature's
  `model/` — the same object the router validates against.
- **Zod defaults:** if you pass `defaultValues` to `useForm`, do **not** also
  use `.default()` in the schema. The schema default overrides the form default
  and the conflict is invisible until a field resets to the wrong value.
- Compose `Field`, `FieldLabel`, `Input`, `FieldError` directly, each wrapped in
  a `Controller`.
- **Loading:** `disabled={mutation.isPending}` on the submit button. Do not
  return early with a spinner — that unmounts the form and loses what was typed.

```tsx
"use client";

import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod";
import { Controller, useForm } from "react-hook-form";
import { toast } from "sonner";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Field, FieldError, FieldGroup, FieldLabel } from "@/components/ui/field";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
import { createOrganizationSchema, type CreateOrganizationInput } from "@/features/organizations";
import { trpc } from "@/utils/trpc";

export function MyForm() {
  const utils = trpc.useUtils();

  const form = useForm<CreateOrganizationInput>({
    resolver: zodResolver(createOrganizationSchema),
    defaultValues: { name: "", slug: "", description: "" },
  });

  const mutation = trpc.organization.create.useMutation({
    onSuccess: async () => {
      toast.success("Organization created");
      await utils.organization.list.invalidate();
    },
    onError: (error) => toast.error(error.message),
  });

  return (
    <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit((values) => mutation.mutate(values))} className="space-y-4">
      <FieldGroup>
        <Controller
          control={form.control}
          name="name"
          render={({ field, fieldState }) => (
            <Field data-invalid={!!fieldState.error}>
              <FieldLabel htmlFor="name">Name</FieldLabel>
              <Input id="name" {...field} disabled={mutation.isPending} />
              <FieldError errors={[fieldState.error]} />
            </Field>
          )}
        />
      </FieldGroup>

      <Button type="submit" disabled={mutation.isPending}>
        {mutation.isPending ? "Saving…" : "Save"}
      </Button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

`FieldError` takes either `errors={[fieldState.error]}` (it de-duplicates and
renders a list when there is more than one) or plain children for a single
message.

`organization-dialog.tsx` is the full worked example, including re-seeding the
form on open so a cancelled edit never leaks into the next one.

## Lists and tables

Anything sortable, filterable or paginated uses the `DataTable` stack in
`@/components/data-table`. A short read-only list — a handful of rows, no
column header worth clicking — is fine as plain `@/components/ui/table`
markup; `member-table.tsx` is that case.

### The stack is server-driven

`useDataTable` is **manual mode**: `manualPagination`, `manualSorting` and
`manualFiltering` are all on. It does not slice an array in the browser. It
keeps page, sort and every filter in the **URL** via `nuqs`, and your procedure
does the work.

That is the property worth having: the URL *is* the state, so a link to "orgs
I own, sorted by newest" reopens exactly that, and a refresh does not reset the
view.

It requires `<NuqsAdapter>` in the root layout — already there.

### Wiring one up

Three pieces, in this order:

1. **A procedure** taking `{ filter, orderBy, pagination }` and returning
   `{ items, total, meta }`. `organization.list` is the reference, and
   `listOrganizationsSchema` in `model/` is the contract between it and the
   table.
2. **Columns**, where a `meta` block is what makes a column filterable — the
   toolbar reads `meta.variant` and renders the control. Nothing registers a
   filter component by hand.
3. **`useDataTable`**, given `pageCount` derived from the server's `total`.

```tsx
{
  id: "name",
  accessorKey: "name",
  header: ({ column }) => <DataTableColumnHeader column={column} title="Organization" />,
  cell: ({ row }) => <span>{row.original.name}</span>,
  enableSorting: true,
  enableColumnFilter: true,
  meta: { label: "Organization", placeholder: "Search names…", variant: "text" },
}
```

| `meta.variant` | Toolbar control | Also needs |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | a debounced input | `placeholder` |
| `select` / `multiSelect` | a faceted popover | `options: Option[]` |
| `date` / `dateRange` | a calendar popover | |
| `range` | a two-handle slider | `range`, `unit` |

```tsx
const { table } = useDataTable({
  data: data?.items ?? [],
  columns,
  pageCount: data ? Math.max(1, Math.ceil(data.total / perPage)) : 1,
  getRowId: (row) => String(row.id),
  initialState: { sorting: [{ id: "name", desc: false }] },
});

if (isLoading && !data) return <DataTableSkeleton columnCount={6} rowCount={5} filterCount={3} />;

return (
  <DataTable table={table}>
    <DataTableToolbar table={table} />
  </DataTable>
);
```

Use `placeholderData: (prev) => prev` on the query. Without it the table
collapses to a skeleton on every page change; with it the previous page stays
on screen until the next arrives.

`DataTableSkeleton` for loading — never `return <div>Loading…</div>`, which
makes the layout jump.

### Reading the URL state back

The query has to run *before* the table is built, because the row count decides
`pageCount` — so the component parses the same search params `useDataTable`
writes. `useOrganizationTableParams` in `organizations-table-view.tsx` is that
function, and the encodings it decodes are:

| Key | Encoding |
|---|---|
| `page`, `perPage` | plain integers, `page` is **one-based** |
| `sort` | `JSON.stringify([{ id, desc }])` |
| a `text` filter | the raw string, under the column id |
| a `multiSelect` filter | comma-separated values, under the column id |

It is a second reader of one source of truth, not a second source of truth. A
hand-edited `?sort=` falls back to the default ordering rather than throwing.

### Empty states

"Nothing matched your filter" and "you have nothing yet" are different
messages, and the second is the one people misread as breakage. `DataTable`
renders "No results." for the first. The second needs its own check —
`organization-list.tsx` asks `organization.listMine` whether the person has any
organizations *at all* before deciding which to show.

## Dialogs

Three tools, in order of how much state you want to own.

### 1. `confirm()` and `selectOne()` — no state at all

Global, promise-based, mounted once under `NiceModal.Provider`. Use these for
anything destructive or for "pick one of many". An event handler reads top to
bottom:

```ts
import { confirm } from "@/components/common/confirm-dialog";
import { selectOne } from "@/components/common/select-dialog";

if (!(await confirm({ title: "Remove Alice?", destructive: true }))) return;
removeMember.mutate({ organizationId, userId });

const picked = await selectOne({ title: "Transfer to", valueKey: "id", renderText, searchFn });
if (!picked) return;
```

`confirm()` takes an optional `onConfirm` that is **awaited before the dialog
closes**, so the button spins while the mutation runs and a throw leaves the
dialog up with the error still on screen. Without it the dialog closes at once
and resolves `true`.

`organization-danger-zone.tsx` uses all three shapes — plain confirm, confirm
with `onConfirm`, and `selectOne` followed by a confirm.

### 2. `NiceModal.create` — a dialog with its own form

For a dialog rich enough to have fields and mutations, and openable from
anywhere:

```tsx
export const OrganizationDialog = NiceModal.create(({ mode, organizationId }) => {
  const modal = useModal();
  return <Dialog open={modal.visible} onOpenChange={(open) => !open && modal.hide()}>…</Dialog>;
});

// from anywhere:
NiceModal.show(OrganizationDialog, { mode: "edit", organizationId });
```

### 3. `useDialogControl` — state a component owns outright

When one component opens one dialog and nobody else needs to:

```tsx
const dialog = useDialogControl<Member>();

<Button onClick={() => dialog.show(member)}>Edit</Button>
<Dialog open={dialog.isVisible} onOpenChange={dialog.hide}>
  <DialogContent>{dialog.data && <MemberForm member={dialog.data} />}</DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

### Dialog composition

A dialog a parent opens takes `open` / `onOpenChange` props and owns none of
that state itself; the **parent** holds it with `useDialogControl`. That split
keeps the dialog reusable and stops two components disagreeing about whether it
is open.

---

## Comboboxes

`ComboBox` takes a `searchFn(query, offset, size)` rather than an options
array, because the lists worth a combobox are the ones too long to hold in a
`<Select>`. Typing debounces into it; "Load more" pages with the same call.
`valueKey` names the field that identifies an option — selection, the tick mark
and the load-more cursor all compare on it.

```tsx
import { ComboBox } from "@/components/common/combobox";

<Controller
  control={form.control}
  name="organization"
  render={({ field, fieldState }) => (
    <Field data-invalid={!!fieldState.error}>
      <FieldLabel>Organization</FieldLabel>
      <ComboBox
        title="Select organization"
        valueKey="id"
        value={field.value}
        onChange={field.onChange}
        renderText={(org) => org.name}
        searchFn={(search, offset, size) =>
          utils.organization.search.fetch({ search, offset, size })
        }
      />
      <FieldError errors={[fieldState.error]} />
    </Field>
  )}
/>
```

`organization.search` is a procedure written to exactly that contract
(`{ search, offset, size }` in, a flat array out). Copy its shape for any other
paginated picker. It only fetches while the popover is open, so a form with six
comboboxes does not fire six queries on mount.

For a plain fixed list — two or three roles, a status — use
`@/components/ui/select` instead. A combobox with four options is a search box
with nothing to search.

---

## Toasts

`toast` from **sonner** — `toast.success`, `toast.error`, and `toast.loading`
with an id to update in place. The `<Toaster />` is mounted in
`components/layout/providers.tsx`.

Every mutation gets an `onError: (e) => toast.error(e.message)`. The router's
messages are written to be read by a person, which is the point of putting them
there rather than throwing bare codes.

---

## The sidebar

The nav is **data**, in `src/config/nav-items.ts`. One renderer (`NavMain`)
draws every level, and gating an item on a role is a field (`roles`) rather
than a conditional buried in markup.

Which level shows is derived from the **route**, never from state, so a deep
link renders the right sidebar on first paint:

```
/dashboard/*                accountNavItems
/dashboard/orgs/[orgId]/*   organizationNavItems(orgId)
```

Adding a level is the same move: read another route param in `app-sidebar.tsx`
and return another `NavGroup[]`. The frame knows how to *pick* a level; it does
not know what any feature needs.

---

## General guidelines

- **tRPC** for all API calls. `trpc.useUtils()` for invalidation.
- **Absolute imports**, `@/...`.
- **Skeletons** over full-page spinners.
- **`staleTime`** on anything the shell renders on every page (the switcher,
  the current user) — refetching those on each navigation is pure noise.
- **Invalidate what changed**, not everything. A mutation that adds a member
  invalidates `listMembers`, `getById` and `list`, because all three show a
  count that just moved.
